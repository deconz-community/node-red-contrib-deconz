### Migrate from 1.3.4

Make sure you backup your flow before updating, you will not be able to downgrade if the configuration is migrated.

Everything should be seamless, all your configurations will be migrated to the new save format. It will save the updated
configuration only when you open the node configuration and click Deploy. If you are not performing it, the node will
migrate the configuration on each start of Node-Red. Check the Node-Red log if you have any errors that shows up. If you
have any issues you may visit the [Deconz-Community Discord](https://discord.gg/3XGEYY9) server or open
an [issue on Github](https://github.com/deconz-community/node-red-contrib-deconz/issues).

### Added

- The nodes now allow multiple device selection.
- The nodes accept [queries](https://deconz-community.github.io/node-red-contrib-deconz/device_queries/) instead of a
  device list.
- Each outputs of the nodes are now customizable. If you don't need the HomeKit output, just remove it.
- Reworked the Auto configuration of server. It looks for Home-Assistant installations as well.

#### Input and Battey nodes

- New output types
    - Attribute - Contains all information about the device, include State and Config.
    - Config - Contains configuration data.
    - Scene Call - Called when a scene is called.
- New properties on messages
    - payload_format - The name of the value or __complete__ if the selected payload is "Complete payload".
    - payload_type - The option selected in the output type.
    - meta_changed - List of param path that changed since last message. Exemple : "state.lastupdated".
- Connection preview, you can press the top right button of each output rule to see what nodes are connected.
- Start output is now configurable for each type. To avoid fake button events you should disable it for switch devices.

#### Get node

- New output types
    - Attribute
    - Config
- New output formats
    - Single - The node will send a message per device that sends data.
    - Array - The node will send a message with all payload inside an array. The message will contain a payload that is
      an array of single message. E.g. msg.payload[0].payload is the payload of the first device. Each element will
      contain only the properties payload, meta, meta_changed. The properties topic, payload_format, payload_raw will be
      on the msg directly.
    - Sum - All properties of the devices will be added individually.
    - Average - All properties of the devices will be added recursively and then divided by the number of devices that
      have that property.
    - Min - The result will be a set with the minimal value of each property.
    - Max - The result will be a set with the maximal value of each property.
