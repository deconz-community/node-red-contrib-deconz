        This issue tracker is for feature requests of the deCONZ plugin for Node-RED.

        If your issue is:
          - a general 'how-to' type question,
          - a feature request or suggestion for a change,

        please use the deCONZ community [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3XGEYY9).

        That way the whole Node-RED user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.

        To help us understand the issue, please fill-in as much of the following information as you can:
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: My idea
      description: A clear & concise description of what the feature should do.
    validations:
      required: false
